# Cloud Auditing Workshop

In 2023 cloud environments are becoming increasingly complex resulting in wide variety of misconfigurations. In this workshop youâ€™ll learn how to use point and shoot tools from the open ecosystem for cloud security assessments along with a few pro tips on how to segment and sandbox those. We will also dive into continuous auditing and how to setup long term dashboards for organizations to assess their maturity over time. Attendees will leave with a firm understanding of how to leverage the tools, articulate which method is better based on use case, and assume various roles (safely) in the AWS.
